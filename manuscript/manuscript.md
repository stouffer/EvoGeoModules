**Coevolutionary dynamics are known act on both species and their interactions
in ways that drive the structure of ecological communities. It remains
unclear, however, how the structure of communities at larger spatial scales
either influences or is influenced by local coevolutionary processes, and
how mechanisms acting at these different scales feedback onto one another.
Here we show that, though species interactions vary substantially over
a continental gradient, the coevolutionary significance of individual
interactions is maintained across different scales. Notably, this occurs
despite the fact that observed community variation at the local scale
frequently tends to weaken or remove community-wide coevolutionary signal.
When considered in terms of the interplay between community ecology and
coevolutionary theory, our results demonstrate that individual interactions
are capable and likely to show a consistent signature of past coevolution
even when woven into communities that do not.**

Ecological interactions often exert important selective pressures on the
species involved. For example, the phenologies of lodgepole pines and red
crossbills respond spatially to the presence of squirrels [@benk03a] and palm
species undergo changes in seed morphology in response to the extinction
of bird dispersing their seeds [@gale13]. Given that interactions are
distributed in similar ways across communities, at both the large [@jord03]
or small [@stou07] scale, it can be argued that much ecological structure
is the end result of evolutionary or coevolutionary dynamics between species
[@eklo11,@stou12]. Unfortunately, while the coevolutionary dynamic of pairs
of interacting species has been well described at macro [@van73] and micro
[@gand08] evolutionary timescales, most attempts to understand how they cascade
up to the levels of diversity of both species and interactions found within
empirical communities have been inconclusive [@hemb14]. Moreover, because
coevolutionary dynamics are often presented as a key driving force behind
ecological structure across both time and space [@thom05], it is crucial to
determine the scale at which they are both relevant and quantifiable.

Historically, the evidence for coevolution in taxonomically diverse communities
is quantified as the degree of matching between the phylogenies of two sets of
interacting organisms [@lege02]. This notion builds on the century-old idea
that extant species interact in a way similar to the way their ancestors did
[@fahr13]. Yet it is considerably more restrictive than just phylogenetic
conservation of species' interactions [@reze07,@eklo11,@stou12], as it
accounts for higher-order constraints. More explicitly, it is thought that
communities that have assembled by successive divergence events should display
phylogenetic congruence, that is (i) have similar phylogenetic trees and
(ii) have species at matching positions in the trees that tend to interact
[@page03;@brooks].  On the other hand, many ecological and evolutionary
processes that occur locally are expected to blur community-wide coevolutionary
signal [@pois15]. One possible explanation is that interactions can display
substantial turnover at ecologically relevant temporal and spatial scales
[@pois12c]: the same two species can interact in different ways under
the effect of local environmental contingencies, spatial mismatch in
species phenologies, variations in population abundances, and chance events
[@pois14].  It is unclear, however, whether these mechanisms influence how
the coevolutionary signal within individual interactions should vary across
spatial scales.

To answer these questions, we study a dataset of interactions between
rodents and their ectoparasites from Western to Eastern Europe [@kras12b]
(Methods Summary). This dataset is uniquely suited for this task as it
represents a paradigmatic system in which species-species interactions are
thought to be driven by macro-evolution and co-speciation events [@vern09],
and coevolutionary signal is indeed significant at the continental level
[@kras12a] ($p \leq 10^{-4}$; Methods Summary). Importantly, it also provides
spatial replication and variability [@kras11] at a scale large enough to
capture macro-ecological processes.

As host-macroparasites interactions are hypothesized to be both ecologically
constrained and evolutionary conserved [@comb01], the phylogenetic congruence
observed at the continental level provides the baseline for expectations in
local communities. Of course, if ecological mechanisms reduce coevolutionary
signal, we should detect coevolution at the continental scale but not
locally. Noting that variation of interactions can decrease congruence, we
analyse the local data at two different levels to test these hypotheses; we
first use *regional* interaction data, which accounts for different species
composition across sites, then the *local* interaction data, which also
accounts for variation in the interactions between observed these species
(Methods Summary). Out of 51 local networks, 35 show no signal of coevolution,
11 show significant coevolutionary signal when using the regional interactions,
and 12 show significant coevolutionary signal using the local interactions
(see *Supp. Mat. 1* for network-level significance values). These results
would appear to support the idea that macro-evolutionary processes such
as co-diversification can have consequences at the macro-ecological level
[@pric03] but may not in fact be detectable at finer spatial scales.

This is particularly apparent when comparing the distribution of network-level
coevolutionary signal at the local and regional scales, relative to the
continental scale (Fig. 2A).  Yet this system-level difference says little
about how individual interactions, on which most of the coevolutionary
mechanisms purportedly act [@thom99], behaves. We show that regardless of the
scale at which the system is observed, the distribution of the contribution
of individual interactions to coevolution is conserved (Fig. 2B). This allows
to understand why networks differ from the continental-level expectation:
networks with interactions that are important for coevolution at the
continental scale have more coevolutionaty signal at the local and regional
scale alike (Fig. 2C). This result shows that network-level property emerge
from the properties of their interactions: because interactions differ in
their total contribution to coevolution, their distribution across different
networks will drive differences in overall coevolutionary signal.

<!-- OLD PARAGRAPH
The fact that we observed a weaker signal of coevolution at the local level
implies that species at matching positions in their phylogenetic trees do
not always interact. One possible explanation is that the spatial turnover of
species' interactions varies in a different ways than the identity of species
[@poull11a]. In this system, communities farther apart contain different
species (*Suppl. Mat. 2*); nevertheless, once the phylogenetic relatedness
between species is accounted for, there is no significant relationship
between spatial distance and species dissimilarity (Fig. 2A). Similarly,
while distant networks are more dissimilar, the way shared species interact
within them is also independent of spatial distance (Fig. 2B).Cumulative
phylogenetic dissimilarity of hosts and parasites similarly increases network,
but not interactionsl, dissimilarity (Fig. 2C). These results all support
the conclusion that interactions do not vary in a way that is captured by
evolutionary mechanisms or history.
--> 

Interactions also ultimately differ in how frequently they vary when the
species involved co-occur [@carstensen;@olit14]. Once more, the literature
on host-parasite interactions usually assumes that the reason why some
interactions are more frequent is because they reflect a significant past
history of coevolution [@mora10]. If this were true, we should observe a
significant, positive correlation between the probability of observing an
interaction and the importance of that interaction for coevolution at the
continental scale (Methods Summary). Surprisingly, we find that neither is
true here since interactions that are important for coevolution are not more
conserved (Fig. 3).

Nonetheless, interactions that *are* observed at the local scale should
retain their signal of contribution to coevolution because they involve
species at matching positions in the phylogenetic trees. Indeed, we find
that interactions that contribute strongly to coevolutionary signal at the
continental scale *also* show a significant tendency to contribute strongly at
the local scale (Fig. 4). Remarkably, this result implies that the remnants
of coevolution are still locally detectable in *individual interactions*
even though it does not leave its imprint on most local networks.

Overall, the results of our analyses demonstrate that there is a sizeable gap
between our current understanding of coevolution as the basis of multi-species
interactions and its applicability to ecological questions. Local networks
show little to no signal of coevolution and the strength of coevolution
between two species is a surprisingly poor predictor of how frequently they interact. In
contrast to the frequent assumption that phylogenetic structure is a key
driver of community structure [@cave09;@mouq12], these data reveal that this impact is actually minimal at
ecologically relevant spatial scales. Despite all the above,
individual interactions are able to maintain their coevolutionary signal even
when the community they are woven into does not. Thinking more broadly, these discrepancies
provide a clear roadmap for bridging the aforementioned gap between our appreciation
of the role of coevolution and its empirically measurable outcomes. 
Network structure is the most parsimonious *mechanism* by which coevolution
proceeds, not the imprint coevolution leaves on ecological communities.

# Methods Summary

<!--**Data -- ** --> We use data on observations of interactions between 121
species of rodents and 205 species of parasitic fleas in 51 locations across
Europe [@kras12b] to build 51 species-species interaction networks.
Interactions were measured by combing rodents for fleas, a method that gives
high quality data as it has a high power of detection [@foobar]. To account for
differential sampling effort and across site variations in abundance, we only
study the networks' incidence matrices (presence and absence of
interactions).

<!--**Networks -- ** --> In our study, we define threes scales for the network
data and analysis--- continental, regional, and local. The continental scale
is the aggregated "metanetwork" which includes all potential interactions
between co-occurring species [@pois12c] (*i.e.*, all species and all their
interactions across the 51 networks). Within each site, the regional scale
is given by the list of observed species and all their possible interactions.
Hence the regional networks are always a perfect subset of the continental
network. The local scale includes only the interactions that were actually
observed in the field at a given site. Therefore, the local and regional
networks always include the same species, but the local network has only a subset
(or, at most, an exact match) of the interactions in the regional network.

<!--**Community phylogenetics --**--> We quantified the coevolutionary signal
in terms of the degree of matching between host and parasite phylogenies given
knowledge of species interactions using the *PACO* method [@balb13], which is
robust to variations in number of species. *PACO* provides measures of both
the network-level congruence (*i.e.*, is the network coevolved?) and the
interaction-level signal (*i.e.*, what is the contribution of each interaction
to the overall coevolutionary signal?). We measured the phylogenetic
dissimilarity between two sites for hosts and parasites using PCD [@ives10], a
measure that accounts for the dissimilarity of species, corrected for the
phylogenetic distance between all species in the dataset. Since it is a
requirement of the methods we use here, the phylogenetic trees for hosts and
parasites were rendered ultrametric (i.e., all species are at the same
distance from the root).

<!--**Interactions dissimilarity --**--> We used the network $\beta$-diversity
approach [@pois12c] to measure the dissimilarity of interactions across sites.
<!--As with the strength of coevolution, we measured
the dissimilarity of the *local* and *regional* networks. We measured the
spatial consistency of an interaction as the number of times it is observed
across all sites, divided by the number of sites in which the two species co-
occur.-->

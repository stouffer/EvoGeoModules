**Coevolutionary dynamics act on both species and their interactions to drive
the structure of ecological communities. It remains unclear, however, how
the structure of communities at larger spatial scales either influences or
is influenced by local coevolutionary processes, and how mechanisms acting
at different scales feedback into one another. Despite this, ecological
networks are known to have a structure that is coherent with evolutionary
processes, which suggest that coevolution may play a role in determining their
extent organisation. Here we show that even though species interaction vary
substantially over a continental gradient, the coevolutionary significance
of individual interactions is maintained at different scales. This occurs
despite the fact that community variation at the local scale tends to
weaken or remove community-wide coevolutionary signal. We provide a new
perspective on the interplay between coevolutionary theory and community
ecology, by establishing the organisational scales at which the different
theories have relevance: interactions are relevant locally, whereas overall
community structure is relevant regionally. Although it has been tempting so
far to understand how coevolution relates to network structure, our results
suggest that the way forward is to understand how network structure may
affect coevolution over space instead.**

Ecological interactions introduce selective pressures on the species involved
-- for example, lodgepole pines and red crossbills traits phenologies respond
spatially to the presence of squirrels [@benk03a], and palm species undergo
changes in seed morphology in response to the extinction of disperser birds
[@galetti]. When taxonomically diverse species are considered at once, groups
of interacting species are delineated by evolutionary boundaries [@eklo11],
invariant structures in the distribution of interactions appear [@jord03],
and conservatism of both the distribution of community modules [@stou07] and
the role of species occupy within them [@stou12] becomes evident. Although
the evolutionary dynamics in interacting species pairs has been well described
[@thom05;@gand08], attempts to understand how these cascade up to generate the
tremendous species diversity of both species and interactions characteristic
of empirical communities have been inconclusive [@hemb14].

In multi-species systems that typically span a large taxonomic range,
coevolution is often measured as the matching between the phylogenies of
two sets of interacting organisms [@desd02a;@lege02]. This build on the
century-old ideas that extant species interact in a way similar to the
way their ancestors did [@fahr13]. "Coevolved" systems should (i) have
approximately similar phylogenetic trees and (ii) species at matching
positions in either trees should interact.  It is not clear, however,
how this idea relates to dynamics occurring at smaller scales [@pois15]:
many ecological and evolutionary processes that occur locally are expected
to blur the phylogenetic signal. The spatial scales at which the different
mechanisms involved are mostly incommensurable: coevolution is expressed
within patches connected by gene-flow [@broc07c;@nuis03], whereas the species
diversity of complex networks is typically observed at spatial scales matching
the species distribution [@have92;@basc09a].

Network-based approaches [@prou05;@dunn06], on the other hand, were designed
to study and describe species-rich systems. Previous empirical findings
revealed the impact of evolutionary dynamics on overall network structure
in food webs [@eklo11;@stou07], pollination networks [@cham14;@vamo14], and
host-parasite networks [@desd02a;@hafn95]. Both micro [@hall10a;@jord03]
and macro [@roop12;@dunn08] evolutionary dynamics have been measured or
modelled in species-rich communities, but there is no understanding of how,
or even of whether, local/micro-evolutionary and regional/macro-evolutionary
feedback into one another.  Another layer of complexity is that ecological
networks are known to vary in their structure over time and space [@pois14]:
the same two species will not interact in a consistent way locally, either
because of local environmental contingencies, by chance, or because their
phenologies do not positively covary in space [@devi12]. As a consequence,
*locally*, the evolutionary signal on network structure is expected to be
buried under much ecological noise, and the effect of coevolution can only
be inferred *regionally*.

should interact.  Notably, it has been shown that species interactions
are not consistent through space [@pois12c;@pois14]. Local loss of both
interactions and species from the regional pool is most likely to result in
observed communities that do not appear to have been shaped by coevolution.

We use data on ectoparasites of rodents from Western to Eastern Europe
[@kras12b] to test the following four hypotheses. First, local species
assemblages do not show evidence of coevolution even though the system
has a whole does. Second, interaction-level coevolutionary signal is
conserved. Third, interaction-level coevolutionary signal does not predict the
spatial consistency of interactions. For each local network, we measure the
strength of coevolution using (i) only local observations and (ii) all
possible interactions between local species (as known from the regional
aggregation of all local networks). This allows us to separate the effect
of species sorting (regional interactions) and interaction sorting (local
interactions). At the regional scale, coevolutionary signal is extremely
strong ($p \leq 10^{-4}$), as established by previous analysis of this system
[@kras12a]. Most local networks, on the other hand, show very little evidence
of phylogenetic congruence. Out of 51 local networks, 35 show no signal
of coevolution, 11 show coevolution when using the regional interactions,
and 12 show coevolution using the local interactions (see *Supp.  Mat. 1*
for network-level significance values). **Figure?**.

This suggests that macro-evolutionary processes (such as co-diversification)
have consequences at the macro-ecological level [@pric03], but may not be
detected at finer spatial scales due to a stronger effect of ecological
processes locally. *PACO* permits the analysis of *how strongly* each
interaction contribute to coevolution, in a way that is as independent as
possible from other interactions. As interactions vary only insofar that there
are some locations in which they *do not* happen, we expect that the overall
contribution of interactions will be the same in the local and regional
networks. For the 5 networks that show evidences of coevolution accounting
both for species and interactions sorting, we measured the contribution of
each interaction locally, and compared it to its contribution to the regional
network. Results are presented in **FIG**. **one-sentence summary**. This is
a key result, as it establishes that although coevolution does not leave an
imprint on local networks, it is still detectable in *interactions*. This is in
line with recent results that established that, although networks are composed
of interactions, both objects seem to have uncoupled behaviors [@olit14].

Species interactions vary in a way that is independent from species
distribution [@pois12c]. One possible explanation is that species that
have a strong (coevolutionary) relationship would either co-distribute
more, or interact more frequently when they co-occur. Should it be true,
we would expect that *coevolved species pairs*, or in other words, species
involved in an interaction contributing strongly to the community-wide
coevolution, should be interacting frequently [@mouq12]. This would result
in a positive association between the frequency of the interaction (the
number of observations of a particular interaction divided by the number
of observations of the tow species together), and its overall importance
for coevolution (here measured in the *regional* network). As we report in
**FIGURE**, we do not find this relationship -- how strongly an interaction
contributes to overall coevolution does not predict how frequently it will
be realized when the two species are put together.

<!--Discussion 3-->

Our results, that (i) local networks show no signal of coevolution and (ii)
the strength of coevolution between two species does not predict how frequently
they interact, fall when in line with recent conclusions about the spatial
dynamics of species interactions. Species interactions vary according to
ecological mechanisms [@pois14]: local population abundance [@cana14], local
mis-matches of phenologies [@oles11a], local micro-environmental conditions
[@pois11b]. And even though network composition varies, the overall network
*structure* remains constant over time [@dupo09], suggesting either (i)
higher-order constraints or (ii) replacement of species by functionally
equivalents from the regional pool. These result show that our current
understanding of coevolution in multi-species interactions does not scale well
to ecological questions -- although phylogenetic structure and interaction
show a strong agreement at the regional scale, the structure of local
communities remains largely driven by ecological constraints. The analysis
of ecological networks has often focused on emerging properties [@blut10]
rather than on the building blocks of the networks, that is species and
interactions. Contrary to the often-argued point that coevolution should
explain the local structure of interactions [@thom13], our result suggests
that given the high variance in local interactions, coupled with the lack
of relationship between coevolution and interaction frequency, local network
structure is more likely to affect coevolution than the other way around.

# Methods

We use data on observations of interactions between 121 species of
rodents and 205 species of parasitic fleas in 51 localities in Europe
[@kras12b]. Individual interactions are aggregated to yield species interaction
networks. All 51 networks (one per locality) are aggregated in a regional
metanetwork [@pois12c]. The phylogenetic tree for hosts and parasites were
rendered ultrametric.

The matching between host and parasite phylogenies knowing the species
interactions is measured using the *PACO* method [@balb13]: *PACO* measures
both the network-level congruence (*i.e.* is the network coevolved) and the
interaction-level signal (*i.e.* what is the contribution of each interaction
to the overall coevolution signal).

Phylogenetic distance between two localities is measured for hosts and
parasites using PCD [@ives10]: this measure accounts for the dissimilarity
of species, corrected for the phylogenetic distance between all species in
the dataset.

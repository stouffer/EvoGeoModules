**Coevolutionary dynamics act on both species and their interactions to drive
the structure of ecological communities. It remains unclear, however, how
the structure of communities at larger spatial scales either influences or
is influenced by local coevolutionary processes, and how mechanisms acting
at different scales feedback into one another. Despite this, ecological
networks are known to have a structure that is coherent with evolutionary
processes, which suggest that coevolution may play a role in determining their
extent organisation. Here we show that even though species interaction vary
substantially over a continental gradient, the coevolutionary significance
of individual interactions is maintained at different scales. This occurs
despite the fact that community variation at the local scale tends to
weaken or remove community-wide coevolutionary signal. We provide a new
perspective on the interplay between coevolutionary theory and community
ecology, by establishing the organisational scales at which the different
theories have relevance: interactions are relevant locally, whereas overall
community structure is relevant regionally. Although it has been tempting so
far to understand how coevolution relates to network structure, our results
suggest that the way forward is to understand how network structure may
affect coevolution over space instead.**

Ecological interactions introduce selective pressures on the species involved
-- for example, lodgepole pines and red crossbills phenologies respond
spatially to the presence of squirrels [@benk03a], and palm species undergo
changes in seed morphology in response to the extinction of disperser birds
[@galetti]. When taxonomically diverse species are considered at once, groups
of interacting species are delineated by evolutionary boundaries [@eklo11],
invariant structures in the distribution of interactions appear [@jord03],
and conservatism of both the distribution of community modules [@stou07] and
the role of species occupy within them [@stou12] becomes evident. Although
the evolutionary dynamics in interacting species pairs has been well described
[@thom05;@gand08], attempts to understand how these cascade up to generate the
tremendous species diversity of both species and interactions characteristic
of empirical communities have been inconclusive [@hemb14].

In multi-species systems that typically span a large taxonomic range,
coevolution is often measured as the matching between the phylogenies of two
sets of interacting organisms [@desd02a;@lege02]. This build on the century-old
ideas that extant species interact in a way similar to the way their ancestors
did [@fahr13]. "Coevolved" systems should (i) have similar phylogenetic trees
and (ii) species at matching positions in either trees should interact. It
is not clear, however, how this idea relates to dynamics occurring at smaller
scales [@pois15]: many ecological and evolutionary processes that occur locally
are expected to blur the phylogenetic signal. The spatial scales at which
the different mechanisms involved are mostly incommensurable: coevolution is
expressed within patches connected by gene-flow [@broc07c;@nuis03], whereas
the species diversity of complex networks is typically observed at spatial
scales matching the species distribution [@have92;@basc09a].

Species interaction networks have a structure which is in part driven
by evolutionary mechanisms, both micro [@hall10a;@jord03] and macro
[@eklo11;@dunn08]. Yet it has recently been demonstrated that ecological
interactions display important turnover over time and space [@pois12c]: the
structure of networks made of the same species is expected to change from one
location to the other, under the effect of local environmental contingencies,
spatial mis-match in species phenologies, variations in population abundances,
and chance events [@pois14]. As a consequence, *locally*, the evolutionary
signal on network structure is expected to be buried under much ecological
noise, and the effect of coevolution can only be inferred *regionally* --
to the point where we must now ask if deep evolutionary history matters at
all at the scale where the structure of ecological networks is relevant to
ecological properties.

<!--I don't think this ¶ is necessary in the final text, but let's keep it
to see the flow at the moment-->

We use data on ectoparasites of rodents from Western to Eastern Europe
[@kras12b] to test the following four hypotheses. First, local (observed)
networks do not show evidence of coevolution, whereas the continental-scale
(henceforth regional) system does. Second, the spatial variation of
species interactions is independent from the variation in phylogenetic
diversity. Third, interactions are distributed spatially in a way that is
independent from their evolutionary history. Finally, the contribution of
interactions to coevolution is similar at the local and regional scale.

At the regional scale, coevolutionary signal is extremely strong ($p
\leq 10^{-4}$), as established by previous analysis of this system
[@kras12a]. Most local networks, on the other hand, show very little
evidence of phylogenetic congruence (Fig. 1). Out of 51 local networks, 35
show no signal of coevolution, 11 show coevolution when using the regional
interactions, and 12 show coevolution using the local interactions (see
*Supp.  Mat. 1* for network-level significance values). This suggests that
macro-evolutionary processes (such as co-diversification) have consequences
at the macro-ecological level [@pric03], but may not be detected at finer
spatial scales due to a stronger effect of ecological processes locally.

![figure1]

This of course implies that the variation of species interactions is not
tied to the phylogenetic relatedness of species across space. Both hosts and
parasites show a distance decay of phylogenetic similarity (Fig. 2A), which
we also observe for the *total* network dissimilarity (*i.e.* species and
interaction variation, Fig. 2B). However when the effect of species variation
is removed, the similarity of interactions shows no correlation to either
spatial distance (Fig. 2C) or host or parasite phylogenetic dissimilarity
(Fig. 2D). These result show that although evolutionary history ties into
species distribution (because communities close in space tend to have related
hosts and parasites), it is a poor predictor of the way these species will
interact.

<!--I like this result after all!-->

Ecological interactions vary only insofar that there are some locations in
which they *do not* happen -- yet some interactions happen more consistently
than others. The literature on host-parasite interaction usually assumes
that some interactions are frequent because they reflect a significant
past history of coevolution [@comb01;@mora10]. Should it be the case, the
correlation between how frequently an interaction is (the number of times
it is observed, divided by the number of time the two species co-occurred)
and the importance of this interaction for coevolution (at the continental
scale) is expected to be significant and positive. We find that it is neither
(Fig. 3). The fact that an interaction is commonly observed does not reflect
past co-evolution, but is most likely explained by local ecological factors:
example mechanisms would be co-distribution of species in environments
in which they can interact [@grav11], positive covariance of traits and
environmental features, or random selection of partners by species with a
wide range of possible interactions [@pois13].

We finally evaluate whether individual interactions contribute equally
to coevolutionary signal in the locals and continental network. An
interaction between two species at matching positions in the tree should
contribute positively to coevolution, regardless of the overall score of
the community. We find that it is indeed the case: interactions contributing
strongly to coevolutionary signal at the continental scale *also* contribute
strongly at the local scale (Fig. 4). This is a key result, as it establishes
that although coevolution does not leave an imprint on local networks, it
is still detectable in *interactions*. This is in line with recent results
that established that, although networks are composed of interactions,
both objects seem to have uncoupled behaviors [@olit14].

<!--Discussion 3-->

Our results, that (i) local networks show no signal of coevolution and
(ii) the strength of coevolution between two species does not predict how
frequently they interact, fall when in line with recent conclusions about the
spatial dynamics of species interactions. Although species interactions vary
according to ecological mechanisms [@pois14], and although the identity of
species in a network varies, the overall network *structure* remains constant
over time [@dupo09]. This can suggest higher-order constraints on structure,
or replacement of species by functionally equivalents from the regional
pool. These result show that our current understanding of coevolution in
multi-species interactions does not scale well to ecological questions --
although phylogenetic structure and interaction show a strong agreement at the
continental scale, community structure remains largely driven by ecological
constraints. Ecological networks analysis has often focused on emerging
properties [@blut10] rather than on the building blocks of the networks,
that is species and interactions. Contrary to the often-argued point that
coevolution should explain the local structure of interactions [@thom13],
our result suggests that given the high variance in local interactions,
coupled with the lack of relationship between coevolution and interaction
frequency, local network structure is more likely to affect coevolution than
the other way around.

# Methods

We use data on observations of interactions between 121 species of
rodents and 205 species of parasitic fleas in 51 localities in Europe
[@kras12b]. Individual interactions are aggregated to yield species interaction
networks. All 51 networks (one per locality) are aggregated in a regional
metanetwork [@pois12c]. The phylogenetic tree for hosts and parasites were
rendered ultrametric.

The matching between host and parasite phylogenies knowing the species
interactions is measured using the *PACO* method [@balb13]: *PACO* measures
both the network-level congruence (*i.e.* is the network coevolved) and the
interaction-level signal (*i.e.* what is the contribution of each interaction
to the overall coevolution signal). For each local network, we measure the
strength of coevolution using (i) only local observations and (ii) all possible
interactions between local species (as known from the regional aggregation of
all local networks). This allows us to separate the effect of species sorting
(regional interactions) and interaction sorting (local interactions).

Phylogenetic distance between two localities is measured for hosts and
parasites using PCD [@ives10]: this measure accounts for the dissimilarity
of species, corrected for the phylogenetic distance between all species in
the dataset.

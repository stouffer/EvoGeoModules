**Coevolutionary dynamics are known act on both species and their interactions
in ways that drive the structure of ecological communities. It remains
unclear, however, how the structure of communities at larger spatial scales
either influences or is influenced by local coevolutionary processes, and how
mechanisms acting at these different scales feedback onto one another.
<!--The structure of ecological interactions determine how these feedbacks are distributed among species in a community.-->
Here we show that, though species interactions vary substantially over a
continental gradient, the coevolutionary significance of individual
interactions is maintained across different scales. Notably, this also occurs
despite the fact that observed community variation at the local scale
frequently tends to weaken or remove community-wide coevolutionary signal.
When considered in terms of the interplay between coevolutionary theory and
community ecology, our results demonstrate that individual interactions are
locally relevant whereas the emerging structure of these interactions across
many species only becomes relevant at regional scales.**

Ecological interactions often exert important selective pressures on the
species involved; for example, lodgepole pines and red crossbills phenologies
respond spatially to the presence of squirrels [@benk03a] and palm species
undergo changes in seed morphology in response to the extinction of bird
dispersing their seeds [@gale13]. In addition, most of these critical
interactions are long-standing from a macro-evolutionary point of view
[@eklo11,@stou12]. Given that  interactions are distributed in similar ways
across communities, at both the large [@jord03] or small [@stou07] scale, it
can be argued that much ecological structure is the end result of evolutionary
or coevolutionary dynamics between species [@XXX]. Unfortunately, while the
coevolutionary dynamic of pairs of interacting species has been well described
[@gand08], most attempts to understand how they cascade up to the levels of
diversity of both species and interactions found within empirical communities
have been inconclusive [@hemb14].

Historically, the evidence for coevolution in taxonomically diverse
communities is quantified as the matching between the phylogenies of two sets
of interacting organisms [@lege02]. This notion builds on the century-old idea
that extant species interact in a way similar to the way their ancestors did
[@fahr13]. More explicitly, it is thought that communities that have assembled
through coevolution should (i) have similar phylogenetic trees and (ii)
species at matching positions in the trees should tend to interact. It is not
clear, however, how well this idea holds when confronted with dynamics
occurring at smaller scales. Indeed, many ecological and evolutionary
processes that occur locally are expected to blur the coevolutionary signal
[@pois15]. One possible explanation is that interactions can display
substantial turnover at ecologically relevant temporal and spatial scales
[@pois12c]: the same two species can interact in different ways under the
effect of local environmental contingencies, spatial mismatch in species
phenologies, variations in population abundances, and chance events [@pois14].
This hints that the impact of deep evolutionary history on community structure
can be weakened by the action of ecological mechanisms at the local scale.

To address these questions, we study a dataset of interactions between rodents
and their ectoparasites from Western to Eastern Europe [@kras12b]. This
dataset is uniquely suited for this task as it represents a paradigmatic
system in which species-species interactions are thought to be driven by
macro-evolution and co-speciation events [@XXX], and coevolutionary signal is
indeed significant at the continental level [@kras12a] ($p \leq 10^{-4}$;
Methods Summary). Importantly, it also provides considerable spatial
replication and variability at a scale large enough to capture macro-
ecological processes (Methods Summary).

Given the typical expectation for host-macroparasite communities [@XXX],
<!--DBS: I think the previous bit should be rephrased but can't think of how.-->
the phylogenetic congruence observed at the continental level provides a
coevolutionary baseline for what could be expected in local communities. On
the other hand, if ecological mechanisms reduce coevolutionary signal, we
should detect coevolution at the continental scale but not locally. Noting
that variation of interactions can decrease congruence, we analyse the local
data at two different levels to test these hypotheses (Methods Summary); we
first use *regional* interaction data, which accounts for species sorting
only, and we next use the *local* interaction data, which corresponds to the
actual observations (species and interactions sorting). Out of 51 local
networks, 35 show no signal of coevolution, 11 show significant coevolutionary
signal when using the regional interactions, and 12 show significant
coevolutionary signal using the local interactions (see *Supp.  Mat. 1* for
network-level significance values). These results would appear to support the
idea that macro-evolutionary processes such as co-diversification can have
consequences at the macro-ecological level [@pric03] but may not in fact be
detectable at finer spatial scales.

<!-- TP I changed the figure a bit, so I rewrote the paragraph, but I think
the last sentence is weak, although it does make the transition smoother
--> The fact that we observed a weaker signal of coevolution at the local level
implies that species at matching positions in their phylogenetic trees
do not always interact. One possible explanation is that the variation of
species interactions is not related to the species phylogenetic relatedness
across different communities. In this system, communities farther apart contain
different species (*Suppl. Mat. 2*), but, once the phylogenetic relatedness
between species is accounted for, there is actually no relationship between spatial
distance and species dissimilarity (Fig. 2A).
<!--This is not surprising, given
than species from this dataset are phylogenetically related, and widespread
across the spatial extent.-->
While distant networks are more dissimilar,
the way shared species interact within them is independent of spatial
distance (Fig. 2B). The same trend exists for community dissimilarity as a
function of (cumulative) phylogenetic dissimilarity of hosts and parasites
(Fig. 2C). These results point to the fact that interactions do not vary in
a way that is driven by evolutionary mechanisms or history.

Interactions also ultimately differ in how frequently they vary when the
species involved co-occur [@carstensen;@olito;@tylianakis]. Once more, the
literature on host-parasite interactions usually assumes that the reason why some interactions
are more frequent is because they reflect a significant past history of
coevolution [@comb01;@mora10]. If this were true, we should observe a significant, positive correlation
between the probability of observing an interaction and the importance of
that interaction for coevolution at the continental scale. Surprisingly, we find that neither is true here
since interactions that are important for coevolution are not more conserved (Fig. 3).

Nonetheless, interactions that *are* observed at the local scale should retain
their signal of contribution to coevolution, because they involve species at
matching positions in the phylogenetic trees. Indeed, we find that interactions
that contribute strongly to coevolutionary signal at the continental scale
*also* show a significant tendency to contribute strongly at the local scale (Fig. 4). Remarkably, this result
implies that the remnants of coevolution are still locally detectable in individual *interactions*
even though it does not leave its imprint on most local networks.

Overall, the results of our analyses demonstrate that there is a sizeable gap
between our current understanding of coevolution as the basis of multi-species
interactions and its applicability to ecological questions. This conclusion is supported by our
observations that (i) local networks show little to no signal of coevolution and (ii)
the strength of coevolution between two species does not predict how
frequently they interact.  Although phylogenetic structure and interactions are largely congruent at the
continental scale, community structure is primarily driven by ecological, and
not evolutionary, constraints. Conversely, individual interactions are able to retain their
coevolutionary signal even when the community they are woven into is not. This
result calls to our attention the fact that, even though the community
structure might not be driven entirely by evolutionary constraints, a subset
of interactions are indicative of past coevolution. Above all else, and
contrary to the oft-repeated point that coevolution should explain the local
structure of interactions [@thom13], our results suggest that local network
structure is far more likely to affect coevolution than the other way around.

# Methods Summary

<!--**Data -- ** --> We study data on observations of interactions between 121
species of rodents and 205 species of parasitic fleas in 51 locations across
Europe [@kras12b] to build 51 species-species interaction networks.
Interactions were measured by combing rodents for fleas, a method that gives
high quality data as it has a high power of detection. To account for
differential sampling effort and across site variations in abundance, we only
study the networks' incidence matrices (presence and absence of
interactions).

<!--**Networks -- ** --> In our study, we define threes scales for the network
data and analysis--- continental, regional, and local. The *continental* scale
is the aggregated "metanetwork" which includes all potential interactions
between co-occurring species [@pois12c] (*i.e.*, all species and all their
interactions across the 51 networks). Within each site, the *regional* scale
is given by the list of observed species and all their possible interactions.
Hence the regional networks are always a perfect subset of the continental
network. The *local* scale includes only the interactions that were actually
observed in the field at a given site. Therefore, the local and regional
networks include the same species, but the local network has only a subset
(or, at most, an exact match) of the interactions in the regional network.

<!--**Community phylogenetics --**--> We quantified the coevolutionary signal
in terms of the degree of matching between host and parasite phylogenies given
knowledge of species interactions using the *PACO* method [@balb13], which is
robust to variations in number of species. *PACO* provides measures of both
the network-level congruence (*i.e.*, is the network coevolved?) and the
interaction-level signal (*i.e.*, what is the contribution of each interaction
to the overall coevolutionary signal?). We measured the phylogenetic
dissimilarity between two sites for hosts and parasites using PCD [@ives10], a
measure that accounts for the dissimilarity of species, corrected for the
phylogenetic distance between all species in the dataset. Since it is a
requirement of the methods we use here, the phylogenetic trees for hosts and
parasites were rendered ultrametric (i.e., all species are at the same
distance from the root).

<!--**Interactions dissimilarity --**--> We used the network $\beta$-diversity
approach [@pois12c] to measure the dissimilarity of interactions across sites.
It does amazing things (though Tim came up with it so maybe this is
universally implicit). <!--As with the strength of coevolution, we measured
the dissimilarity of the *local* and *regional* networks. We measured the
spatial consistency of an interaction as the number of times it is observed
across all sites, divided by the number of sites in which the two species co-
occur.-->

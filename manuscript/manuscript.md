**Coevolutionary dynamics act on both species and their interactions
to drive the structure of ecological communities. It remains unclear,
however, how the structure of communities at larger spatial scales either
influences or is influenced by local coevolutionary processes, and how
mechanisms acting at different scales feedback into one another. Most of
these feedbacks are mediated by the structure of ecological interactions,
*i.e.* how they are distributed within communities.  Here we show that,
though species interactions vary substantially over a continental gradient,
the coevolutionary significance of individual interactions is maintained
across different scales. Intriguingly, this also occurs despite the fact that
community variation at the local scale tends to weaken or remove community-wide
coevolutionary signal. When considered in terms of the interplay between
coevolutionary theory and community ecology, our results demonstrate that
individual interactions are locally relevant whereas the emerging structure
of these interactions across many species only becomes relevant at regional
scales. **

Ecological interactions are capable of introducing strong selective pressures
on the species involved; for example, lodgepole pines and red crossbills
phenologies respond spatially to the presence of squirrels [@benk03a]
and palm species undergo changes in seed morphology in response to the
extinction of bird dispersers [@galetti]. When taxonomically diverse species
are considered at once, groups of interacting species are delineated by
evolutionary boundaries [@eklo11], invariant structures in the distribution
of interactions appear [@jord03], and conservatism of both the distribution
of community modules [@stou07] and the role of species occupy within them
[@stou12] becomes evident. Although the evolutionary dynamics in interacting
species pairs has been well described [@thom05;@gand08], attempts to understand
how these cascade up to generate the tremendous species diversity of both
species and interactions characteristic of empirical communities have been
inconclusive [@hemb14].

Historically, coevolution in many-species systems that span a large taxonomic range is often quantified as the matching between the phylogenies of two
sets of interacting organisms [@desd02a;@lege02]. This notion builds on the century-old
idea that extant species interact in a way similar to the way their ancestors
did [@fahr13]. More explicitly, "coevolved" systems should (i) have similar phylogenetic trees
and (ii) species at matching positions in either trees should interact. It
is not clear, however, how this idea relates to dynamics occurring at smaller
scales [@pois15]: indeed, many ecological and evolutionary processes that occur locally
are expected to blur the phylogenetic signal. The spatial scales at which
the different mechanisms involved are mostly incommensurable: coevolution is
expressed within patches connected by gene-flow [@broc07c;@nuis03], whereas
the species diversity of complex networks is typically observed at spatial
scales matching the species distribution [@have92;@basc09a].

Species interaction networks have a structure which is in part driven
by evolutionary mechanisms, both micro [@hall10a;@jord03] and macro
[@eklo11;@dunn08]. Yet it has recently been demonstrated that ecological
interactions display important turnover over time and space [@pois12c]: the
structure of networks made of the same species is expected to change from one
location to the other, under the effect of local environmental contingencies,
spatial mis-match in species phenologies, variations in population abundances,
and chance events [@pois14]. As a consequence, *locally*, the evolutionary
signal on network structure is expected to be buried under much ecological
noise, and the effect of coevolution can only be inferred *regionally* --
to the point where we must now ask if deep evolutionary history matters at
all at the scale where the structure of ecological networks is relevant to
ecological properties.

DBS: I'm so glad you left this note as this was one of my comments. I agree that most of it shouldn't appear as a whole paragraph, but do think that each key idea must appear near the start of the corresponding paragraphs.

In order to better understand the interplay between coevolutionary theory and community ecology, we study data a dataset of rodent ectoparasites from Western to Eastern Europe
[@kras12b].
$\dots$to test the following four hypotheses. First, local (observed)
networks do not show evidence of coevolution, whereas the continental-scale
(henceforth regional) system does. Second, the spatial variation of
species interactions is independent from the variation in phylogenetic
diversity. Third, interactions are distributed spatially in a way that is
independent from their evolutionary history. Finally, the contribution of
interactions to coevolution is similar at the local and regional scale.

Consistent with previous studies of this system [@kras12a], we found that coevolutionary signal at the regional scale is extremely strong ($p
\leq 10^{-4}$), as established by previous analysis of this system
[@kras12a]. Most local networks, on the other hand, show very little
evidence of phylogenetic congruence (Fig. 1). Out of 51 local networks, 35
show no signal of coevolution, 11 show coevolution when using the regional
interactions, and 12 show coevolution using the local interactions (see
*Supp.  Mat. 1* for network-level significance values). This suggests that
macro-evolutionary processes such as co-diversification have consequences
at the macro-ecological level [@pric03], but may not in fact be detectable at finer
spatial scales due to a stronger local effect of ecological processes.

![figure1]

This implies that the variation of species interactions is not
tied to the phylogenetic relatedness of species across space. In this system, the phylogenetic similarity of both hosts and
parasites decays with increasing distance (Fig. 2A), and 
we observe the same for the *total* network dissimilarity (*i.e.* species and
interaction variation, Fig. 2B). In contrast, when we control for the effect of species variation, we find that the similarity of interactions is independent of both
spatial distance (Fig. 2C) and host or parasite phylogenetic dissimilarity
(Fig. 2D). Therefore, while evolutionary history is tightly linked to species distribution---since communities close to each other tend to have related
hosts and parasites---these results show that it is also rather poor predictor of the way in which these species ultimately interact.

<!--I like this result after all!-->

Ecological interactions vary only insofar that there are some locations in
which they *do not* happen -- yet some interactions happen more consistently
than others. The literature on host-parasite interactions usually assumes
that some interactions are more frequent because they reflect a significant
past history of coevolution [@comb01;@mora10]. Should this be the case, the
correlation between the probability of observing an interaction
<!--(the number of times
it is observed, divided by the number of time the two species co-occurred)-->
and the importance of that interaction for coevolution at the continental
scale should be positive and significant. Surprisingly, we find that neither is true here
(Fig. 3). The fact that an interaction is commonly observed does not reflect
past co-evolution, but is most likely explained by local ecological factors:
example mechanisms would be co-distribution of species in environments
in which they can interact [@grav11], positive covariance of traits and
environmental features, or random selection of partners by species with a
wide range of possible interactions [@pois13].

We finally evaluate whether individual interactions contribute equally
to coevolutionary signal in the locals and continental network. An
interaction between two species at matching positions in the two phylogenetic trees should
contribute positively to coevolution, regardless of the overall score of
the community. We find that this is indeed the case: interactions that contribute
strongly to coevolutionary signal at the continental scale *also* contribute
strongly at the local scale (Fig. 4). Remarkably, this result implies that 
coevolution is still detectable in individual *interactions*  even though it does not leave its imprint on most local networks. This is in line with recent results
that established that, although networks are composed of interactions,
both objects seem to have uncoupled behaviors [@olit14].

<!--Discussion 3-->

Overall, the results of our analyses demonstrate that our current understanding of coevolution as the basis of
multi-species interactions scales rather poorly to ecological questions.
Although phylogenetic structure and interactions are largely congruent at the
continental scale, community structure is primarily driven by ecological, and not evolutionary,
constraints. This conclusion is supported by our observations that (i) local networks show no signal of coevolution and
(ii) the strength of coevolution between two species does not predict how
frequently they interact.
<!--
fall when in line with recent conclusions about the
spatial dynamics of species interactions. Although species interactions vary
according to ecological mechanisms [@pois14], and although the identity of
species in a network varies, the overall network *structure* remains constant
over time [@dupo09]. This can suggest higher-order constraints on structure,
or replacement of species by functionally equivalents from the regional
pool.  Ecological networks analysis has often focused on emerging
properties [@blut10] rather than on the building blocks of the networks,
that is species and interactions.

<!--
DBS: I would insert a sentence here the explicitly highlights the interaction-level results.
-->
Above all else and contrary to the oft-repeated point that
coevolution should explain the local structure of interactions [@thom13],
our results suggest that
<!--given the high variance in local interactions,
coupled with the lack of relationship between coevolution and interaction
frequency
-->
local network structure is far more likely to affect coevolution than
the other way around.

# Methods

We study data on observations of interactions between 121 species of
rodents and 205 species of parasitic fleas in 51 locations across Europe
[@kras12b] to build 51 species-species interaction networks.
<!--Individual interactions are aggregated to yield species interaction
networks.-->
We also aggregated thse 51 networks in order to describe the regional "metanetwork" that therefore includes all potential interactions between co-occurring species [@pois12c]. The phylogenetic trese for hosts and parasites were
rendered ultrametric.

We quantified the degree of matching between host and parasite phylogenies given knowledge of species
interactions using the *PACO* method [@balb13]. *PACO* provides measures
of both the network-level congruence (*i.e.*, Is the network coevolved?) and the
interaction-level signal (*i.e.*, What is the contribution of each interaction
to the overall coevolutionary signal?). For each local network, we measure the
strength of coevolution using (i) local observations only and (ii) all possible
interactions between locally co-occuring species (based on the interactions found in the regional metanetwork). Testing both of these networks allows us to separate the effect of species sorting
(regional interactions) and interaction sorting (local interactions).

We quantified the phylogenetic distance between two locations for hosts and
parasites using PCD [@ives10]: this measure accounts for the dissimilarity
of species, corrected for the phylogenetic distance between all species in
the dataset.

# Recommendation by the Subject Editor

Dear Dr. Poisot,

Let me apologize for not getting feedback to you more promptly. This was due to
different reasons. First, it has been extremely difficult to find two reviewers
for this ms. Several reviewers declined to do it but I have been trying with
patience until we got the two reviews discussed below. As it turned out,
I believe the final reviewer's comments were useful. The second reason is
due to me and my schedule, and not due to the Oikos editorial process.

Your manuscript entitled "Interactions retain the co-phylogenetic matching
that communities lost" has now been seen by 2 referees, whose comments are
attached below. Both reviewers agree the paper present an interesting analysis
to understand co-diversification between parasites and small mammals. Both
mention that the paper is concise and goes to the point and the introduction
is clear. Yet, there are several aspects that need to be substantially
improved before we move forward this ms. Specifically, reviewers feel 1)
that what the methods are actually doing needs to be explained more clearly
(see comments about Figure 1 and several comments from both reviewers);
2) authors have to clarify more which is the delineation of the different
spatial scales. For example, as mentioned by one of the reviewers, how well
matching at the local scale reflects matching at the regional scale rather
than the absolute signal itself, and 3) the interpretation of the analysis
need to be sharpened, otherwise the ms. is going to be quite difficult to
understand for the Oikos reader.

My major concern is that both reviewers mention explicitly problems with the
clarity of the methods. For example one of the reviewers explicitly states
"...The key finding (lines 221-223) sounds very interesting, but even after
much re-reading, I don't fully understand how it emerges from the analyses
here." Could authors make an effort to make the connection between main
findings and methods more clear? Both reviewers make points to improve
the clarity of the ms., from suggestions to draw cartoons to a more clear
explanation of the PACo method and how the results would compare against a
randomization test of a null model.

At this stage, I strongly recommend authors to explain better the methods
used in this ms. and make a better connection between methods and the main
results. This includes making some figures more clear and introducing in
the ms. point by point all the reviewer's suggestions. Should further work
allow you to address these comments and criticisms by doing a major revision,
we would be happy to look at a revised manuscript.

# Reviewer 1

This manuscript uses phylogenetic network properties to assess the signal of
host-parasite interactions across different spatial scales. I like the general
approach that it may be clearer to interpret differences in network matching
signal (e.g., how well matching at the local scale reflects matching at the
regional scale), rather than the absolute signal itself. The manuscript
overall is concise and to the point. In interpreting my comments, please
keep in mind that this work is a bit outside my area of expertise, although I
do work in other ways on phylogenetic methods and spatial species interactions.

Lines 44-48: This sounds like an important point, but I can't understand it
(though I admittedly haven't read most of those references). What are these
"constraints"?

Data, and line 141: Where did the rodent and flea phylogenies come from?
What does "rendered ultrametric" entail? (Divergence time estimation is a
huge and complex field...) The details of phylogeny estimation are probably
irrelevant here, but it would be good to be reassured that well-supported
trees are used.

The explanation of continental/regional/local networks on page 5 is pretty
clear, but a cartoon or simple figure could help. It might also be a good
way to explain the expectations on lines 145-156, which I had more trouble
following.

I also had trouble grasping the PACo method (lines 130-142). It seems that
this is the method all the analyses are based on, so explaining it clearly
is essential for a reader to interpret the results. Again, a small network
picture might be very helpful for explaining what this method does, what
its properties are, and what it means for a result to be "significant."

While reading all of the results, I kept wondering how they would compare
against a randomization test of a null model. For example, if many fake local
networks are generated randomly from regional networks, what uncertainties
would be attached to each point in Figure 2? Or maybe this is how significance
testing with PACo works (e.g., lines 162-163)?

When interpreting the number of sites that exhibit various results
(lines 162-163, 219, Fig 2), how should spatial autocorrelation shape
our interpretation? For example, do the results carry more weight if
"significant" sites are not close to one another?

Lines 183 and 185: That should be Fig 3AB, not Fig 2AB.

In Figure 1, it is hard to distinguish open from closed circles. Using
different shapes would help.

Lines 230-233: This made me wonder if the loss of signal at the smaller
spatial scale could be due to lower sample size, i.e., fewer species present.
Perhaps line 133 is saying that this isn't the case, but again, I don't
really know what PACo is doing.

Lines 233-235: This feels like over-reaching. This work has assessed,
at best, this particular host-parasite interaction, not "potential species
interactions" as a whole.

# Reviewer 2

Poisot and Stouffer present the results of a cross-scale analysis of
co-diversification between parasites and small mammals. The introduction of
this paper is clear and brings up some interesting issues at the interface of
macro-evolution and ecology. However, I had a difficult time following the
delineation of the different spatial scales, which is central to the study.
This was made more difficult by the very low contrast between colors and
the poor resolution of figure 1. In addition, it wasn’t clear to me
how the analyses were interpreted. This was exacerbated by the lack of
supplemental materials, which are referenced in the paper but were not online.
Overall, I think the paper has some potentially interesting findings, but the
definitions, analyses, and interpretation need more explicit description to
make it easier to interpret the study within the broader context of literature
on community assembly.

36-38: I had some difficulty understanding the ‘cascade up’ part of
this sentence. I think you’re trying to get a lack of predictability,
but I’m a bit lost on the specifics.

54: does

71: matching

106-114: I had difficulty understanding how regions were delineated and what
the total number of regions were in the dataset. Ideally (from an ecological
perspective), regions would correspond to distinct environmental areas with
little movement between areas. The definition used here seems to be largely
separate from an ecological definition of a region.

146-148: Since the interaction described here is an antagonistic one I’m
not sure how community assembly would favor co-occurrence.Where does the
selection come in? If it’s just that specialist parasites can only occur
on the suitable host I would refer to that as environmental filtering.

148 on the contrary?

160: The terminology ‘ecological mechanisms’ is confusing in this context.
Wouldn’t a species interaction (like parasite and host) quality as an
ecological mechanism? Perhaps abiotic variance or something related to
community assembly would be a better term to differentiate between historical
processes and factors that influence local assembly.

162-166: It’s not clear to me how these results are to be taken. What
percentage would have to show matching to demonstrate that local interactions
trump co-evolution at local or regional scales? The hypotheses for this
paper are explicit, which is great, but the cutoffs on how to interpret
the data are not described. Are the differences in phylogenetic matching
between scales local and regional scales ‘significantly different’
(both biologically and statistically)?

173-174: I think there is a word missing here

181: I think this needs addition explanation on the mechanism vs. measure
front.

196: partners

207-210: Is this result significant (statistically)?

Fig. 1: The colors do not provide good contrast. It is not really possible
to see patterns because of the poor color choices. Also the quality of this
image is not good.

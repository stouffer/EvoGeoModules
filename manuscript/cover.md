Dear Dr. Campbell,

We are happy to inform you of our decision to submit our manuscript entitled
*Coevolution acts more on interactions than it does on community structure*
for publication in *Nature*. We believe that our manuscript will be of
general interest to the *Nature*'s readership for the following reasons.

There is persistent debate between evolutionary biologists and ecologists
about the degree to which the structure of ecological communities is the
result of coevolution in the past or ecological processes in the present. One
particular idea, however, that these two groups *do* agree upon is that species-species
interactions are a key mechanism driver underlying both of these phenomena. In this regard,
the effects of antagonistic interactions---such as those between predators and their
prey or parasites and their hosts---are considered to be particularly
important.  

Nevertheless, a paucity of empirical data has made it exceedingly
difficult to tease apart the concurrent effects of coevolution and ecological
processes to determine the scale at which each is dominant.



Summary 1 (for the Editor):

, and current ecological
processes. Although it has been tempting so far to understand how coevolution
relates to community structure, our results suggest that the way forward is
to understand how network structure may affect coevolution over space instead.

Summary 2 (for the press):

Understanding the structure of complex networks, how it has emerged, and
how it influences future dynamics, are key research topics in ecology,
sociology, physics, and many other fields. While there has been considerable growth in studies of whole network structure, the importance of Our results
establish that individual interactions retain some properties that entire
networks may lose. This should result in a shift of our attention from
networks to their individual components.

Our submission includes the main manuscript (XXXX words with four embedded figures),
an *Extended Methods* section of YYY words, and two files of Supplementary Information
(as PDF documents). All data and code for analysis are available online.

Thank you for your consideration of our manuscript,   
Dr. Timothee Poisot

Dear Dr. Goymer,

We are happy to inform you of our decision to submit our manuscript
entitled *Coevolution leaves a stronger imprint on interactions than it
does on community structure* for publication in *Nature*. We believe that
our manuscript will be of general interest to *Nature*'s readership for the
following reasons.

There is persistent debate between evolutionary biologists and ecologists about
the degree to which the structure of ecological communities is the result of
coevolution in the past or ecological processes in the present. One of the few
points that are mutually agreed upon is that species-species interactions are
the key mechanism/driver underlying both phenomena. Moreover, the effects of
antagonistic interactions---such as those between predators and their prey
or parasites and their hosts---are considered to be particularly important,
because the "stakes" are high for both types of organisms involved.

Over the past five years, a series of papers have laid the groundwork for
the strong relationship between species' evolutionary history and interaction
networks (*e.g.*, Rezende et al. *Nature* (2007), Gomez et al. *Nature* (2010),
Stouffer et al. *Science* (2012)). In almost all cases, however, these studies
have focused on phylogenetic conservation of species' interactions---the
idea that closely-related species tend to interact with similar species.
Notably, these studies all drew implicit or explicit parallels to the idea
of coevolution, despite the fact that phylogenetic conservatism of interactions
does not adress the higher-order constraints involved in the coevolutionary process.
As of now, a comprehensive investigation of how coevolution acts on the structure of species-species interactions have
been lacking at large scales. This is the gap that our manuscript fills,
and as such, we firmly believe that our present manuscript represents a
natural and crucially important next step.

In our study, we apply cutting-edge methods to quantify the coevolutionary
signal in interaction networks from an unprecedented dataset of host-parasite
interactions on a continental scale. With this combination of techniques and
data, we test a variety of commonly-held but seldom-tested coevolutionary
hypotheses. We highlight the fact that what we scientists understand of
coevolution has been shaped more by the spatial scale at which we observed
its outcome than by the systematic testing of hypotheses drawn from the
purported impact of coevolutionary mechanisms. Intriguingly, we demonstrate
that particular species-species interactions are able to maintain their
coevolutionary signal even when they are woven into a community that does
not. Overall, our results suggest that the way forward in coevolutionary
studies is to understand how network structure affects coevolution, and *not*
the other way around.

Summary 1 (for the Editor):

Every ecological community is ultimately the outcome of evolutionary
and coevolutionary processes in the past and ecological processes in the
present. Previous studies have described the way that extant interactions
can be captured by knowing species' evolutionary relationships while
failing to quantify whether coevolution between these species underpins
this observation.  Here, we demonstrate how the fingerprint of coevolution
is eroded away by distinct ecological processes, but also show that this
signal is most manifest in interactions as opposed to whole networks. This
implies that network structure is the most parsimonious mechanism by which
coevolution proceeds and not the imprint it leaves on ecological communities.

Summary 2 (for the press):

Understanding the structure of complex networks is a key research topic in
ecology, sociology, physics, and many other fields. At its most fundamental
level, the way in which present-day network structures have emerge is more
important for us to truly understand the systems these networks describe. In
ecological communities, observed networks are the end results of species
evolution and/or coevolutionary processes between species.  We demonstrate
here that the importance of individual interactions for coevolution can
easily get lost if we naively assume that coevolution is necessarily a
community-wide phenomena. This result implies that many network studies
should benefit from a fundamental shift of our attention from the networks
themselves to the impact of their individual components.

Dear Dr. Campbell,

We are happy to inform you of our decision to submit our manuscript entitled
*Coevolution acts more on interactions than it does on community structure*
for publication in *Nature*.

We believe that our manuscript will be of general interest to the readership
of *Nature* for the following reasons. There is a perennial debate about
the degree to which the structure of ecological communities is the result
of coevolution in the past or ecological processes in the present. 

Summary 1 (for the Editor):

, and current ecological
processes. Although it has been tempting so far to understand how coevolution
relates to community structure, our results suggest that the way forward is
to understand how network structure may affect coevolution over space instead.

Summary 2 (for the press):

Understanding the structure of complex networks, how it has emerged, and
how it influences future dynamics, are key research topics in ecology,
sociology, physics, and many other fields. While there has been considerable growth in studies of whole network structure, the importance of Our results
establish that individual interactions retain some properties that entire
networks may lose. This should result in a shift of our attention from
networks to their individual components.

Our submission includes the main manuscript (XXXX words with four embedded figures),
an *Extended Methods* section of YYY words, and two files of Supplementary Information
(as PDF documents). All data and code for analysis are available online.

The following scientists have the technical skills and expertise to be ideal reviewers of this work: .

Thank you for your consideration of our manuscript,   
Dr. Timothee Poisot

Dr. Philip Campbell   
Editor in Chief, Nature

Dear Dr. Campbell,

We are happy to inform you of our decision to submit our manuscript entitled
*Coevolutionary acts more on interactions than it does on community structure*
for publication in *Nature*.

We believe that our manuscript will be of general interest to the
readership of *Nature* for the following reasons. The structure of ecological
communities is thought to relect both past coevolution, and current ecological
processes. Although it has been tempting so far to understand how coevolution
relates to community structure, our results suggest that the way forward is
to understand how network structure may affect coevolution over space instead.

Our manuscript will be of interest to a broad audience
of scientists. Understanding the structure of networks (ecological or
otherwise), how it emerges, and how it influences future dynamics, is a key
research topic. Our results establish that individual interactions retain
some properties that entire networks may lose. This should result in a shift
of our attention from networks to their individual components.

Our submission includes the main manuscript (XXXX words, four figures),
an *Extended Methods* section of YYY words, and two Supplementary Materials
(as PDF documents). All data and code for analysis are available online.

Thank you for your consideration of our manuscript,   
Dr. Timothee Poisot

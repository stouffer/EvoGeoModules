Dear Dr. Campbell,

We are happy to inform you of our decision to submit our manuscript entitled
*Coevolution leaves a stronger imprint on interactions than it does on community structure*
for publication in *Nature*. We believe that our manuscript will be of
general interest to *Nature*'s readership for the following reasons.

There is persistent debate between evolutionary biologists and ecologists
about the degree to which the structure of ecological communities is
the result of coevolution in the past or ecological processes in the
present. Amidst this debate, one idea that these two groups *do* agree
upon is that species-species interactions are a key mechanism/driver
underlying both of these phenomena. Moreover, the effects of antagonistic
interactions---such as those between predators and their prey or parasites
and their hosts---are considered to be particularly important.

Over the past five years, a series of papers have laid the groundwork for
the strong relationship between species' evolutionary history and interaction
networks (e.g., Rezende et al. *Nature* (2007), Gomez et al. *Nature* (2010),
Stouffer et al. *Science* (2012)). In almost all cases, however, these studies
have focused on phylogenetic conservation of species' interactions---the
idea that closely-related species tend to interact with similar species.
Notably, these studies all drew implicit or explicit parallels to the idea
of coevolution, despite the fact that these two patterns are not the same
by any stretch of the imagination. As such, we firmly believe that our
present manuscript represents a natural and crucially important next step.

In our study, we apply cutting-edge methods to quantify the coevolutionary
signal in interaction networks with an unprecedented dataset of host-parasite
interactions on a continental scale. With this combination of techniques and
data, we test a variety of commonly-held but seldom-tested coevolutionary
hypotheses. In addition, we demonstrate that what we as scientists actually
understand about coevolution is contingent upon the spatial scale of the
data studied and the ecological scale at which we observe that coevolution
acts. Intriguingly, we demonstrate that particular species-species
interactions are able to maintain their coevolutionary signal even when
they are woven into a community that does not.




Summary 1 (for the Editor):

Every ecological community is ultimately the outcome of evolutionary and coevolutionary processes in the past and ecological
processes in the present. Previous studies have described Although it has been tempting so far to understand how coevolution
relates to community structure, our results suggest that the way forward is
to understand how network structure may affect coevolution over space instead.

Summary 2 (for the press):

Understanding the structure of complex networks, how it has emerged, and
how it influences future dynamics, are key research topics in ecology,
sociology, physics, and many other fields. While there has been considerable growth in studies of whole network structure, the importance of Our results
establish that individual interactions retain some properties that entire
networks may lose. This should result in a shift of our attention from
networks to their individual components.

Our submission includes the main manuscript (XXXX words with four embedded figures),
an *Extended Methods* section of YYY words, and two files of Supplementary Information
(as PDF documents). All data and code for analysis are available online.

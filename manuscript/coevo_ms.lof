Spatial consistency is defined as the probability of observing an interaction between two species given that they were observed to co-occur. Although statistically significant, there was no biologically meaningful relationship between spatial consistency and an interaction's importance for coevolution in the continental network (\relax $R^2 \approx 0.01\relax \GenericError { }{LaTeX Error: Bad math environment delimiter}{See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.}{Your command was ignored.\MessageBreak Type I <command> <return> to replace it with another command,\MessageBreak or <return> to continue without it.}, \relax $\rho = -0.1\relax \GenericError { }{LaTeX Error: Bad math environment delimiter}{See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.}{Your command was ignored.\MessageBreak Type I <command> <return> to replace it with another command,\MessageBreak or <return> to continue without it.}, \relax $p \leq 10^{-5}\relax \GenericError { }{LaTeX Error: Bad math environment delimiter}{See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.}{Your command was ignored.\MessageBreak Type I <command> <return> to replace it with another command,\MessageBreak or <return> to continue without it.}).}}{14}{figure.3}

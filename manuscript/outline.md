# Introduction

- Overview of theory on coevolution, including spatial aspects (GMTC, coevo in metaco, ...)
- Difference (more than semantics) in micro-coevolution vs. co-cladogenesis, brief review of my book chapter
- Upper limit on organisational scale of the theory, many populations within a few species
- Large organizational scales for species interactions are well handled by network representation, also allows description of replicated interactions (metaweb)
- Known phylogenetic structure in networks, but unclear how it relates to micro-{eco/evo} processes
- **Goals of the paper**: Lay out map for research bridging coevo with ecological networks, using illustrations from empirical dataset

# Point 1 -- Strong hypothesis that macro-evolutionary processes have macro-ecological consequences

# Point 2 -- Interactions respond locally to micro-processes

# Point 3 -- The spatial replication of networks is imperfect

# Point 4 -- Emergent network properties may not respond to evolutionary mechanisms

In this study, we use mathematical models to explore the ecological and evolutionary factors that modulate the explanatory power of phylogenetic information for communities of species that interact within a single trophic level. We find that phylogenetic relationships among species can influence trait evolution and rates of interaction among species, but only under particular models of species interaction. For example, when interactions within communities are mediated by a mechanism of phenotype matching, phylogenetic trees make specific predictions about trait evolution and rates of interaction. In contrast, if interactions within a community depend on a mechanism of phenotype differences, phylogenetic information has little, if any, predictive power for trait evolution and interaction rate. Together, these results make clear and testable predictions for when and how evolutionary history is expected to influence contemporary rates of species interaction.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12384/abstract","DOI":"10.1111/ele.12384","ISSN":"1461-0248","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Nuismer","given":"Scott L."},{"family":"Harmon","given":"Luke J."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,1,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",11,16]]},"container-title-short":"Ecol Lett"},

Simple models for food web structure aim at disentangling the complexity of ecological interaction networks and detect the main forces that are responsible for their shape. Trophic interactions are influenced by species traits, which in turn are largely determined by evolutionary history. Closely related species are more likely to share similar traits, such as body size, feeding mode and habitat preference than distant ones. Here, we present a theoretical framework for analysing whether evolutionary history—represented by taxonomic classification—provides valuable information on food web structure. In doing so, we measure which taxonomic ranks better explain species interactions. Our analysis is based on partitioning of the species into taxonomic units. For each partition, we compute the likelihood that a probabilistic model for food web structure reproduces the data using this information. We find that taxonomic partitions produce significantly higher likelihoods than expected at random. Marginal likelihoods (Bayes factors) are used to perform model selection among taxonomic ranks. We show that food webs are best explained by the coarser taxonomic ranks (kingdom to class). Our methods provide a way to explicitly include evolutionary history in models for food web structure.","URL":"http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/279/1733/1588","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2011.2149","ISSN":"0962-8452, 1471-2954","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Eklöf","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Helmus","given":"Matthew R."},{"family":"Moore","given":"M."},{"family":"Allesina","given":"Stefano"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,4,22]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",10,18]]},"PMID":"22090387"},

The integration of biogeography and network theory will yield important results and further our understanding of species interactions. It has, however, been hampered so far by the difficulty to quantify variation among interaction networks. Here, we propose a general framework to study the dissimilarity of species interaction networks over time, space or environments, allowing both the use of quantitative and qualitative data. We decompose network dissimilarity into interactions and species turnover components, so that it is immediately comparable to common measures of β-diversity. We emphasise that scaling up β-diversity of community composition to the β-diversity of interactions requires only a small methodological step, which we foresee will help empiricists adopt this method. We illustrate the framework with a large dataset of hosts and parasites interactions and highlight other possible usages. We discuss a research agenda towards a biogeographical theory of species interactions.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12002/full","DOI":"10.1111/ele.12002","ISSN":"1461023X","language":"ENG","author":[{"family":"Poisot","given":"Timothée"},{"family":"Canard","given":"Elsa"},{"family":"Mouillot","given":"David"},{"family":"Mouquet","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Gravel","given":"Dominique"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",9,2]]},"container-title-short":"Ecol.

These networks are two-mode networks sharing many common properties with others such as food webs, social, and abiotic networks. Here we describe generalized patterns in the topology of 29 plant–pollinator and 24 plant–frugivore networks in natural communities. Scale-free properties have been described for a number of biological, social, and abiotic networks; in contrast, most of the plant–animal mutualistic networks (65.6%) show species connectivity distributions (number of links per species) with a power-law regime but decaying as a marked cut-off, i.e. truncated power-law or broad-scale networks and few (22.2%) show scale-invariance. We hypothesize that plant–animal mutualistic networks follow a build-up process similar to complex abiotic nets, based on the preferential attachment of species. However, constraints in the addition of links such as morphological mismatching or phenological uncoupling between mutualistic partners, restrict the number of interactions established, causing deviations from scale-invariance. This reveals generalized topological patterns characteristic of self-organized complex systems. Relative to scale-invariant networks, such constraints may confer higher robustness to the loss of keystone species that are the backbone of these webs.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1461-0248.2003.00403.x/abstract","DOI":"10.1046/j.1461-0248.2003.00403.x","ISSN":"1461-0248","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Jordano","given":"Pedro"},{"family":"Bascompte","given":"Jordi"},{"family":"Olesen","given":"Jens M."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,1,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",3,6]]}},

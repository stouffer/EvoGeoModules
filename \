**Coevolutionary dynamics act on both species and their interactions to
drive the structure of ecological communities. It remains unclear, however,
how the structure of communities at larger spatial scales either influences
or is influenced by local coevolutionary processes, and how mechanisms acting
at different scales feedback into one another. The structure of ecological
interactions determine how these feedbacks are distributed among species of a
community. Here we show that, though species interactions vary substantially
over a continental gradient, the coevolutionary significance of individual
interactions is maintained across different scales. Notably, this also
occurs despite the fact that community variation at the local scale tends
to weaken or remove community-wide coevolutionary signal. When considered in
terms of the interplay between coevolutionary theory and community ecology,
our results demonstrate that individual interactions are locally relevant
whereas the emerging structure of these interactions across many species
only becomes relevant at regional scales.**

Ecological interactions exert selective pressures on the species involved;
for example, lodgepole pines and red crossbills phenologies respond
spatially to the presence of squirrels [@benk03a] and palm species undergo
changes in seed morphology in response to the extinction of bird dispersing
their seeds [@gale13]. Most of these interactions are long-standing from
a macroevolutionary point of view [@eklo11], explaining why the way that
interactions are distributed is so similar across communities, either at the
large [@jord03] or small [@stou07] scale. This suggests that large and small
scale structure results from evolutionary dynamics of speces. Although the
evolutionary dynamics of interacting species pairs has been well described
[@gand08], attempts to understand how these cascade up to generate the
tremendous diversity of both species and interactions found within empirical
communities have been inconclusive [@hemb14].

Historically, coevolution in taxonomically diverse communities is quantified
as the matching between the phylogenies of two sets of interacting organisms
[@lege02]. This notion builds on the century-old idea that extant species
interact in a way similar to the way their ancestors did [@fahr13]. More
explicitly, it is thought that communities that assembled through coevolution
should (i) have similar phylogenetic trees and (ii) species at matching
positions in either trees should interact. It is not clear, however, how
this idea holds when confronted with dynamics occurring at smaller scales:
indeed, many ecological and evolutionary processes that occur locally are
expected to blur the phylogenetic signal [@pois15]. One possible reason is
that interactions can display substantial turnover, at ecologically relevant
temporal and spatial scales [@pois12c]: the same two species can interact in
different ways under the effect of local environmental contingencies, spatial
mismatch in species phenologies, variations in population abundances, and
chance events [@pois14]. This suggests that the impact of deep evolutionary
history on community structure can be lessened by the action of ecological
mechanisms at the local scale. To adress this question, we study a dataset of
rodent and their ectoparasites from Western to Eastern Europe [@kras12b]. This
dataset is uniquely suited for this task, as it offers an unprecedented
spatial replication at a scale large enough to capture macro-ecological
processes. In addition, host-macroparasite associations are expected to
be driven by macro-evolution and co-speciation events. This dataset also
exhibits spatial variation in interactions across different localities.

If ecological mechanisms do reduce evolutionary signal, we should
detect coevolution at the continental scale but not locally. Phylogenetic
congruence is strong at the continental level [@kras12a] ($p \leq 10^{-4}$),
which offers the baseline for the expected level of congruence in local
communities. Because variation of interactions can decrease congruence,
we analyse the local data at two different levels (see methods): using the
*regional* interaction data, which accounts for species sorting only, and
the *local* interaction data, which corresponds to the actual observations
(species and interactions sorting). Out of 51 local networks, 35 show no signal
of coevolution, 11 show coevolution when using the regional interactions,
and 12 show coevolution using the local interactions (see *Supp.  Mat. 1*
for network-level significance values). This suggests that macro-evolutionary
processes such as co-diversification have consequences at the macro-ecological
level [@pric03], but may not in fact be detectable at fine spatial scales.

<!-- TP I changed the figure a bit, so I rewrote the paragraph, but I think
the last sentence is weak, although it does make the transition smoother
--> The fact that the signal of coevolution is lessened at the local level
implies that species at matching positions in their phylogenetic trees
do not always interact. One possible explanation is that the variation of
species interactions is not related to the species phylogenetic relatedness
across different communities. In this system, communities farther apart had
different species (*Suppl. Mat. 2*), but once the phylogenetic relatedness
between species is accounted for, there is no relationship between spatial
distance and species dissimilarity (Fig. 2A). This is not surprising, given
than species from this dataset are phylogenetically related, and widespread
across the spatial extent. While distant networks are more dissimilar,
the way shared species interact within them is indepedant of spatial
distance (Fig. 2B). The same trend exists for community dissimilarity as a
function of (cumulative) phylogenetic dissimilarity of hosts and parasites
(Fig. 2C). These results point to the fact that interactions do not vary in
a way that is driven by evolutionary mechanisms or history.

![Relationships between spatial distance, phylogenetic dissimilarity, and the dissimilarity of interactions.](../figures/figure4.pdf)

Interactions also ultimately differ in how frequently they vary when
the species involved are co-occurring [@carstensen,@olito,@tylianakis]. The literature on
host-parasite interactions usually assumes that some interactions
are more frequent because they reflect a significant past history of
coevolution [@comb01;@mora10]. Should this be the case, the correlation
between the probability of observing an interaction and the importance
of that interaction for coevolution at the continental scale should be
positive and significant. Surprisingly, we find that neither is true here
(Fig. 3). Interactions that are important to coevolution are not more
conserved.

![Lack of relationship between the probability of observing an interaction, and its contribution to coevolution in the continental network. Each interaction is weighted by the number of times the two species involved have been observed together. (*temp.*)](../figures/figure3.pdf)

Nonetheless, interactions that persisted at the local scale should retain
their signal of contribution to coevolution, because they involve species at
matching positions in the phylogenetic trees. We find that interactions that
contribute strongly to coevolutionary signal at the continental scale *also*
contribute strongly at the local scale (Fig. 4). Remarkably, this result
implies that coevolution is still detectable in individual *interactions*
even though it does not leave its imprint on most local networks.

<!--Discussion 3-->

Overall, the results of our analyses demonstrate that our current understanding
of coevolution as the basis of multi-species interactions scales rather poorly
to ecological questions.  Although phylogenetic structure and interactions are
largely congruent at the continental scale, community structure is primarily
driven by ecological, and not evolutionary, constraints. This conclusion
is supported by our observations that (i) local networks show no signal
of coevolution and (ii) the strength of coevolution between two species
does not predict how frequently they interact. Yet, individual interactions
retained their coevolutionary signal whereas the community they are weaved
into did not. Above all else and contrary to the oft-repeated point that
coevolution should explain the local structure of interactions [@thom13],
our results suggest that local network structure is far more likely to affect
coevolution than the other way around.

# Methods

**Data -- ** We study data on observations of interactions between 121 species
of rodents and 205 species of parasitic fleas in 51 locations across Europe
[@kras12b] to build 51 species-species interaction networks. Interactions
were measured within a 50 km radius around each point reported in Fig. 1, by
combing rodents for fleas. This method gives high quality data, are it has a
very high power to detect even rare interactions. To account for differential
sampling effort, we converted all of the quantitative data in binary one,
so that our networks describe the presence and absence of interactions.
We also aggregated these 51 networks in order to describe the continental
"metanetwork" that therefore includes all potential interactions between
co-occurring species [@pois12c]. We define threes scales in the data. The
*continental* scale is the aggregated metanetwork, *i.e.* all species and
all their interactions. Within each site, the *regional* scale is the list of
observed species, and all their possible interactions. The regional networks
is a perfect subset of the metanetwork; the *local* scale is the interactions
that were actually observed in the field at a given site. Local and regional
scales have the same species, but local has only a subset (or at most an
exact match) of the interactions in the regional level.

**Community phylogenetics --** The phylogenetic trees for hosts and parasites,
published alongside the original network data, were rendered ultrametric. We
quantified the degree of matching between host and parasite phylogenies given
knowledge of species interactions using the *PACO* method [@balb13]. *PACO*
provides measures of both the network-level congruence (*i.e.*, is the network
coevolved?) and the interaction-level signal (*i.e.*, what is the contribution
of each interaction to the overall coevolutionary signal?). For each local
network, we measure the strength of coevolution using (i) local observations
only and (ii) all possible interactions between locally co-occurring species
(based on the interactions found in the regional metanetwork). Testing
both of these networks allows us to separate the effect of species sorting
(regional) and interaction sorting (local). We quantified the phylogenetic
dissimilarity between two sites for hosts and parasites using PCD [@ives10]:
this measure accounts for the dissimilarity of species, corrected for the
phylogenetic distance between all species in the dataset.

**Interactions dissimilarity --** We used the network $\beta$-diversity
approach [@pois12c] to measure the dissimilarity of interactions across
sites. We specifically measured the dissimilarity of the *regional* and
*local* networks. We built a probabilistic model of the occurrence of each
interaction based on the following rule: the probability that an interaction
is observed is the number of times it is observed across all sites, divided
by the number of sites in which the two species co-occur.
